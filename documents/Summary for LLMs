### **Summary for Gemini: Calibrating a Causal Transformer with Aggregate RCT Data**

**(This document provides the high-level context, motivation, and workflow for the project. For detailed implementation steps, please refer to the full `Project Execution Plan` PDF.)**

**1. Motivation & Problem Statement**

This project addresses the critical challenge of bridging the gap between two primary sources of medical evidence:

*   **Rich Observational Data (e.g., EHRs):** Provides large-scale, real-world data to train complex models like Causal Transformers for individual-level treatment effect predictions. However, these models may suffer from unmeasured confounding and lack the "gold-standard" trust of RCTs.
*   **Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs):** Provide unbiased, "gold-standard" evidence for population-level average treatment effects (ATEs). However, they are expensive, cover narrow populations, and do not provide individual-level predictions.

Our Causal Transformer, trained on large EHR datasets (like SCI-Diabetes), can predict individual outcomes, but its aggregate predictions may not align with the findings of published RCTs. This discrepancy, or "error," needs to be corrected to ensure the model is clinically trustworthy and accurate.

**2. Project Aim**

The primary aim is to develop and implement a system that uses a Causal Transformer to generate powerful individual-level predictions, which are then rigorously calibrated using the aggregate results from a collection of existing RCTs. The final output should be a patient-specific treatment effect estimate that is not only personalized but also consistent with high-quality clinical trial evidence, complete with a principled uncertainty quantification. The current version will aim to predict the ATE for a target population (e.g., predicting the result of a new trial).

**3. Core Methodology & The "Manifold Hypothesis"**

The core idea is the "Manifold Hypothesis": the prediction error of our Causal Transformer is not random but is systematically related to the characteristics of the population being studied. For example, the model might consistently overestimate the treatment effect in older populations and underestimate it in younger, healthier populations. This relationship can be learned.

Our methodology consists of two main components:

*   **A Base Predictor:** A pre-trained Causal Transformer that generates raw, individual-level counterfactual predictions.
*   **A Calibration Model:** A Gaussian Process (GP) regressor that learns the "calibration manifold"â€”the relationship between population characteristics and the Causal Transformer's prediction error.
*   **Data Structure for the Base Predictor:** The Causal Transformer is a sequence model that processes patient data as temporal "tokens". Our project fully leverages this by representing patient **covariates (X)** and **outcomes (Y)** as time-series sequences. To facilitate calibration against two-arm RCTs, we simplify the **treatment (A)** stream from a time-varying sequence to a single, binary assignment at a "time-zero" index date. This maintains the model's power to learn from dynamic patient histories while aligning with the structure of our calibration data.

**4. Agreed Summary Workflow**

The project will be executed following this specific workflow:

1.  **Train Transformer:** A Causal Transformer is trained once on the large, longitudinal observational dataset (e.g., SCI-Diabetes) to act as our base predictor.
2.  **Simulate & Predict for RCTs:** For each of our `N` available RCTs:
    *   Create a synthetic cohort of virtual patients that statistically matches the baseline characteristics of the RCT population (as reported in its "Table 1").
    *   Run this synthetic cohort through the pre-trained Causal Transformer to get its predicted Average Treatment Effect (ATE_transformer_i).
3.  **Feature Engineering for Populations:** For each of the `N` simulated RCT cohorts, compute a `Population_Vector`. This is a feature vector of summary statistics (e.g., mean/SD of age, baseline HbA1c, sex ratio) that numerically describes that specific population.
4.  **Calculate Target Error:** For each RCT `i`, calculate the prediction error, which becomes the target variable for our calibration model:
    `Error_i = ATE_transformer_i - ATE_rct_i`
    (where `ATE_rct_i` is the actual ATE reported in the RCT publication).
5.  **Visualize Manifold Hypothesis:** Use a dimensionality reduction technique like t-SNE on the `Population_Vectors` and color the points by their `Error_i`. This plot will serve as a visual confirmation of the manifold hypothesis.
6.  **Train Calibration Model:** Train a Gaussian Process (GP) regressor to learn the mapping from population characteristics to the prediction error:
    `GP(Population_Vector) -> Error`
    The GP is chosen because it naturally provides both a point estimate for the error and its uncertainty.
7.  **Deploy for Calibrated Prediction:** To make a prediction for a new target population:
    *   The Causal Transformer generates a raw prediction (ATE_raw).
    *   A `Population_Vector` is computed for the new target population.
    *   The trained GP uses this `Population_Vector` to predict the expected error (delta_predicted) and its uncertainty.
    *   The final, calibrated estimate is calculated as: `ATE_calibrated = ATE_raw - delta_predicted`, accompanied by the uncertainty interval from the GP.
