How can we test the assumptions of consistency, exchangeability and positivity?
- sensitivity analyses to different combinations of covariates
- combinations of covariates chosen and tested for each counterfactual pair (e.g. SGLT2i vs DPP4i)
- clearly state assumptions and get them reviewed by experts
- ensure that assumptions are regularly reviewed to align with current scientific consensus
- ensure that the causal question (esp intervention) is clearly defined
- end result (does it calibrate well with RCT data)

Must clearly specify:
- eligibility criteria (how to match RCT eligibility criteria in observational data)?
- interventions
- outcomes
- start and end of follow up
- counterfactual pairs
- DAG

Specifying the DAG:
- Generate DAGS for the calibration RCTs.
- Ensure there is agreement between RCTs in terms of DAG.
- Ensure all arrows are well-specified enough to be causal.
- Run this DAG by Chris, other subject matter experts.
- Paste DAG, proposal and causal inference book into Gemini and ask for critique.
- Run it past Chris again.
- Ensure the DAG is published for peer review.

IP weighting, can we justify:
- IP weighting vs standardization, matching or stratification.
- Can this apply to individuals

Confounding by indication:
- RCTs have random assignment, but in observational data e.g. SGLT2i will be prescribed due to high CV risk
- Need to ensure we have controlled for this

Overadjustment bias:
- Are we adjusting for variables which are also downsteam of treatment? (see fine point 7.4 from book)
- The difference-in-differences approach uses a negative outcome control e.g. pre-treatment hba1c
to adjust for unmeasured confounders. Do we do anyting similar with negative outcome controls?

Selection bias:
- How do we deal with selection bias in our observational data compared with RCT data. 
In particular
- Differential loss to follow up 
- Missing data bias
- Healthy worker bias
- Volunteer bias
- Treatment received before beginning of trial period

Collider bias:
- Some of our baseline covariates are also effects of treatment.
- How do we deal with this?

Loss to follow up:
- Must be included in the DAG and we can decide whether to condition on it.
- Can maybe use IP weighting for this variable C.
- Must treat censoring due to death differently from loss to follow up.

Measurement bias:
- Is there recall bias in our observational data?
- Are measurement errors independent nondifferential?
- Draw DAG without measurement error first
- focus on confounding and selection bias originally
- then can add in measurement bias

Other considerations:
- Effect modification
- Transportability to different populations
- Is there interference present (e.g. 2 individuals in same home, one is prescribed lifestyle interventions)
- Have we controlled for 3 forms of systematic bias (confounding, selection and measurement)

Questions:
- Is our proposal consistent with FFRCISTG? If not, how does it handle time-varying confounding?
