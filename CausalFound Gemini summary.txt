Project Summary: Calibrating a Causal Transformer with Aggregate RCT Data

1. Motivation & Problem Statement

This project addresses the critical challenge of bridging the gap between two primary sources of medical evidence:

    Rich Observational Data (e.g., EHRs): Provides large-scale, real-world data to train complex models like Causal Transformers for individual-level treatment effect predictions. However, these models may suffer from unmeasured confounding and lack the "gold-standard" trust of RCTs.

    Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs): Provide unbiased, "gold-standard" evidence for population-level average treatment effects (ATEs). However, they are expensive, cover narrow populations, and do not provide individual-level predictions.

Our Causal Transformer, trained on large EHR datasets (like SCI-Diabetes), can predict individual outcomes, but its aggregate predictions may not align with the findings of published RCTs. This discrepancy, or "error," needs to be corrected to ensure the model is clinically trustworthy and accurate.

2. Project Aim

The primary aim is to develop and implement a system that uses a Causal Transformer to generate powerful individual-level predictions, which are then rigorously calibrated using the aggregate results from a collection of existing RCTs (e.g., EMPA-REG). The final output should be a patient-specific treatment effect estimate that is not only personalized but also consistent with high-quality clinical trial evidence, complete with a principled uncertainty quantification. Later versions of the project will aim to predict effect-size for an individual but the current version will aim to predict ATE for a population (for example, predicting the result of a RCT that is already underway).

3. Core Methodology & The "Manifold Hypothesis"

The core idea is the "Manifold Hypothesis": the prediction error of our Causal Transformer is not random but is systematically related to the characteristics of the population being studied. For example, the model might consistently overestimate the treatment effect in older populations with high comorbidity and underestimate it in younger, healthier populations. This relationship between population features and prediction error can be learned.

Our methodology consists of two main components:

    A Base Predictor: A pre-trained Causal Transformer that generates raw, individual-level counterfactual predictions based on rich patient features from observational data.

    A Calibration Model: A Gaussian Process (GP) regressor that learns the "calibration manifold." It models the relationship between a population's characteristics and the Causal Transformer's prediction error.

4. Agreed Summary Workflow

The project will be executed following this specific workflow:

    Train Transformer: A Causal Transformer is trained once on the large observational dataset (e.g., SCI-Diabetes) to act as our base predictor.

    Simulate & Predict for RCTs: For each of our N=25 available RCTs:

        Create a synthetic cohort of virtual patients that statistically matches the baseline characteristics of the RCT population (as reported in its "Table 1").

        Run this synthetic cohort through the pre-trained Causal Transformer to get its predicted Average Treatment Effect (ATE_transformer_i).

    Feature Engineering for Populations: For each of the N simulated RCT cohorts, compute a Population_Vector. This is a feature vector of summary statistics (e.g., mean/SD of age, baseline HbA1c, sex ratio, key comorbidity proportions) that numerically describes that specific population.

    Calculate Target Error: For each RCT i, calculate the prediction error, which becomes the target variable for our calibration model:
    Error_i = ATE_transformer_i - ATE_rct_i
    (where ATE_rct_i is the actual ATE reported in the RCT publication).

    Visualize Manifold Hypothesis: Use a dimensionality reduction technique like t-SNE on the Population_Vectors and color the resulting points by their Error_i. This plot will serve as a visual confirmation of the manifold hypothesisâ€”i.e., that similar populations have similar errors.

    Train Calibration Model: Train a Gaussian Process (GP) regressor to learn the mapping from population characteristics to the prediction error:
    GP(Population_Vector) -> Error
    The GP is chosen because it naturally provides both a point estimate for the error and its uncertainty.

    Deploy for Calibrated Prediction: To make a prediction for a new target population (or a single individual, who can be treated as a population of one):

        The Causal Transformer generates a raw prediction (ATE_raw).

        A Population_Vector is computed for the new target population.

        The trained GP uses this Population_Vector to predict the expected error (delta_predicted) and its uncertainty.

        The final, calibrated estimate is calculated as: ATE_calibrated = ATE_raw - delta_predicted, accompanied by the uncertainty interval from the GP.
